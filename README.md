# kernel-process-tree
This project was made as a part of the Operating Systems Course (UE23CS242B) at PES University. The objective of the project is to execute a program that will create multiple child processes in which memory is allocated dynamically. While this task is executing, generate an output with the process id and the memory map of each child process in a tree structure.
